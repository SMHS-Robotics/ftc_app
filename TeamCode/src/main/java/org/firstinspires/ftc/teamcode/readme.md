## haha i don't know what's going on
Welcome!

If you are a member of the San Mateo High School robotics team and you've stumbled upon this repository as the first step in your journey to programmerhood, i'm sorry to say that you're in for a long, hard road. the documentation within this repository is nonexistent. the code is messy, broken, old, and inconsistent. nobody knows what any of it means. good luck.
